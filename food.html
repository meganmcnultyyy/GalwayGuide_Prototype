				<h3>Ard Bia </h3>
				<p>One of Galway’s most enduring restaurants, housed in one of the citys most iconic restaurant spaces, Ard Bia has always placed as much emphasis on community experiences and aesthetic stimulation as on serving great food in a fun environment. We believe in having roots in a place whilst having an identity that transcends location and takes inspiration from around the world. </br> <strong>Spanish Arch, The Long Walk, Galway, H91 E9XA</strong></p>

				<h3>Dela</h3>
				<p>Season permitting we grow as much of our own produce as possible on our ever expanding farm located in Moycullen on the proposed Galway-Clifden Greenway. At peak growing season our greens & eggs have a ‘plot to plate’ time of  minutes. We love craft beer & brewing in particular. When we’re not developing our own beer recipes we are always looking at the exciting  Irish Craft Beer scene with an emphasis upon the newer smaller brewers.</br><strong>51 Lower Dominick Street in Galways West End</strong></p>

				<h3>Kirwans Lane</h3>
				<p>Our restaurant is located in the heart of the medieval centre of Galway in the historical Kirwans Lane, which still exhibits a strong presence of 16th and 17th century architecture. Owner Mike O’Grady opened the two-floor restaurant in 1996, soon after the lane was restored from its derelict state. We offer modern Irish food prepared with quality fresh local produce. Our speciality is seasonal seafood, but diners have plenty of choice, from meat to vegetarian dishes.</br><strong>The Seafood Bar @ Kirwan's,
